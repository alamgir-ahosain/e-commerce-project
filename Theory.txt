Structure of a JWT
  A JWT has three parts, separated by dots (.):  <Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
    1. Header
        1. alg: the signing algorithm 
        2. typ: type of token 
        {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT"
        }  
    2. Payload
        1. Contains claims (information about the user or token).   
        {
        "email": "a1@gmail.com",
        "password":""123"
        }
    3.Signature    
        1. Ensures the token is not tampered with.
        2. Created by encoding the header and payload, then signing with a secret key:

        HMACSHA256(
            base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
            secret
    )

How it Works
    1. User logs in → server verifies credentials.
    2. Server creates JWT → signs with secret key.
    3. Client stores token → sends it in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
    4. Server verifies token → grants access if valid.
Advantages
    1. Stateless (no server session storage).
    Compact and portable.
    2. Secure (signature prevents tampering).

Limitations
    1. Cannot revoke easily.
    2.Don’t store sensitive info in payload.
